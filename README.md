-Welcome to my Alarm project. After learning only the basic C# syntax, I managed to build my first but simple application using Unity.


-What can this app do? And what functionalities are implemented?
The application can be used as a stopwatch which counts seconds, minutes and hours after the play button was pressed. There are also 2 secondary functions like: Reset and Lap.
The Lap button if pressed, prints the current time on the input field, which occurs after the "Lap" button was pressed the first time.
The Reset button simply resets the current time shown on the timer as well as the laps information.

The two icons at the bottom allow the user to switch between the timer and the stopwatch. Since I have already explained the functionality of the stopwatch, I am going to proceed
with the Timer.

Timer is used as a countdown to determine how many times can an operation occur inside the chosen timer frame. The user is allowed to add seconds by pressing the "+15s" button or 
to add minutes by pressing the "+1min" button.
If the Timer reaches zero seconds, the audio clip will play.
